We need to describe the "main building blocks" and element types you will use in your scripts
These are:

Test plan
Thread Groups
Sampleres
Config elements
listeners
timers
assertions
pre-post processors

------------------------
TestPlan: basic for entire Jmeter 
           a collection of elements that define how to simulate a user's interaction with a web application or server
           

Thread Groups: 
           its job is to create thread
          threads were the no of users
          Defines the number of USERS, RAMP-UP PERIOD AND LOOP COUNT.

Sampleres:
          Simulates a user's request, such as HTTP, FTP, or JDBC.
          Will have these:
              
                - Name: The name of the Sampler.
                - Protocol: The protocol to use (e.g., HTTP, FTP, etc.).
                - Server: The server name or IP address.
                - Port: The port number to use.
                - Method: The request method (e.g., GET, POST, etc.).
                - Path: The URL path.
                - Headers: Any additional headers to include in the request.
                - Body Data: Any data to include in the request body.

  Constant Timer:
          a type of timer that introduces a constant delay between requests
  
  Assertion:
          -a test element that allows you to verify that the response from the server meets certain conditions. 
          -to validate the correctness of the response data, such as the response code, headers, body content, and more.

  Setting PreProcessor ---->JSR223
  Setting PostProcessor---->JSR223

  Enable ViewResultTree

  Clear the logs

  execute---> we can see the request, respone body, headers
